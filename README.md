## Introduction

In this project, we focus on the growing trend of international medical education. Countries like **Russia**, **Uzbekistan**, **Kazakhstan**, **Philippines**, **Georgia**, **Kyrgyzstan**, **Egypt**, and **China** are gaining popularity among students wishing to pursue their medical education abroad. Our website presents a comprehensive overview of the top countries for MBBS, their unique offerings, admission processes, and eligibility criteria.

## Features of the Website

- **Responsive Design**: The website is fully responsive and works seamlessly across all devices, from desktops to smartphones.
- **TailwindCSS Framework**: We've used TailwindCSS to make the design elegant, modern, and easy to scale. With minimal effort, we achieved a clean design, and with the help of animations, we made the user experience more engaging.
- **Animation Effects**: The website includes smooth animations on elements like buttons and sections as you scroll, offering an interactive experience to the visitors.
- **Google Analytics Integration**: For tracking and analyzing website traffic.
- **Facebook Pixel Integration**: This allows for efficient tracking of user activity and effective advertisement campaigns.

## Sections of the Website

The website consists of several key sections that provide important information:

1. **Hero Section**: The homepage introduces visitors to the concept of studying MBBS abroad. It includes a call-to-action button that directs users to the application section of the website.
2. **Why Study MBBS Abroad**: This section highlights the benefits of pursuing MBBS in foreign countries, including **affordable tuition**, **global exposure**, and **high-quality education**.
3. **Top Countries for MBBS**: A section featuring countries like **Russia**, **Uzbekistan**, and others, each with a brief overview and flag representation.
4. **Admission Process & Eligibility**: Explains the step-by-step process for applying to MBBS programs abroad, including eligibility requirements and application procedures.
5. **Lead Generation Form**: The website includes a lead generation form where prospective students can enter their details, such as name, email, phone number, and preferred country, to receive more information.
6. **Footer**: A footer section containing basic copyright information.

## Custom JavaScript

Weâ€™ve also incorporated custom JavaScript to validate the form submission. When users submit their details through the lead generation form, the form checks that all required fields are filled in before allowing submission. If all fields are completed, an alert confirms successful submission.

```javascript
document.getElementById('leadForm').addEventListener('submit', function (e) {
  e.preventDefault();
  const name = document.getElementById('name').value;
  const email = document.getElementById('email').value;
  const phone = document.getElementById('phone').value;
  const country = document.getElementById('country').value;

  if (name && email && phone && country) {
    alert('Form submitted successfully!');
    // AJAX or fetch can be added here for backend integration
  } else {
    alert('Please fill all fields.');
  }
});
```
